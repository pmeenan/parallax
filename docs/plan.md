# Plan

**This is a living document.** It will change as the project evolves — milestones will be
re-scoped, re-ordered, split, or added as measurements and findings come in. That churn is
expected and healthy; what is *not* allowed is silent change. Scope changes get a
decision-log entry; progress changes are reflected here by checking boxes and updating
status lines as work lands.

Milestones are ordered by risk: platform substrate before content, greybox before art,
one district before two. Each has exit criteria the harness can verify. Check a box only
when the item is done and verified (per root rule: measured, not asserted); partially
done items stay unchecked, optionally with a note.

**Status legend:** `pending` · `in progress` · `done` · `parked`

Active milestones retain task-level progress notes. Once a milestone is complete, compress
it to its delivered scope, final outcomes, unresolved carry-forwards, and exit evidence;
incremental run history remains in decisions.md, rough-edges.md, dependencies.md, and the
harness result artifacts.

## Standing gate — dependency currency

D-079 and [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) apply to every milestone. Review all direct
dependencies and versioned external inputs at milestone entry and every 28 days while a
milestone is active, whichever comes first; credible security advisories trigger an
immediate review, as do due deferral triggers and releases that credibly fix or unblock
an issue affecting planned or implemented work. Candidates are adopted or explicitly
deferred under risk-tier gates, never auto-updated. A milestone cannot exit with a
currency checkpoint older than 28 days; one full checkpoint may cover an exit and the
immediately following milestone entry in the same transition change. Runtime-critical
upgrades require same-scenario before/after evidence on the relevant registered machine;
exact pins and D-020 repeatability remain mandatory.

## M0 — Harness + skeleton  `done`

The measurement loop everything else depends on, plus the thinnest possible end-to-end
app: a Babylon Lite WebGPU scene in a render worker, served with COOP/COEP, deployed and
measured automatically.

- [x] Build/serve and app skeleton: deterministic separated engine/game bundles under the
      pinned D-014/D-020 toolchain, immutable local serving with COOP/COEP (D-010/D-011),
      and a Babylon Lite WebGPU scene running in the render worker. The frozen public
      placeholder was published once at parallax-web.com (D-021/D-022).
- [x] Harness v1: sandboxed pinned-Chrome fresh/warm `smoke@1`, registered environment
      identity, artifact plus dirty-tree identity, versioned mandatory metrics, diffable
      JSON/Markdown reports, blocking budgets, and explicit informational observability
      gaps (D-051/D-062/D-063). D-087 added the locked machine-local baseline store and
      separate actor/reason promotion transition.
- [x] Worker substrate spikes: dedicated-worker WebGPU + OffscreenCanvas **go** (D-056),
      paired fixed-capacity SPSC SAB rings **go** (D-057), and worker OPFS sync reads a
      **qualified go** for M1's storage boundary (D-058/D-066). D-096 removed the
      standalone microbenchmark after D-091's representative OPFS-to-renderable
      cell-load p95 became mandatory; historical repeatability remains RE-023.
- [x] Browser AI spike: Prompt API is a measured **no-go as a required backend** in
      pinned CfT (D-059/RE-019), while its sandboxed branded-Chrome install,
      restart/resume, post-restart, and offline lifecycle qualified separately (D-065).
      D-096 resolved P-007 in favor of the app-owned backend and removed both closed
      Prompt API harnesses while preserving their decision/finding/result evidence.
- [x] App-owned AI spike: pinned Gemma 4 E2B QAT GGUF on wllama WebGPU qualified with
      structured-output and OPFS lifecycle evidence; CPU/WASM remains measured headroom,
      not an automatic fallback (D-073/D-074; RE-030/RE-031/RE-032). Restart-persistent
      KV snapshots were a measured no-go for this runtime; live idle pre-seeding remains
      the preferred follow-up (D-075/D-084). D-095 removed the superseded ONNX/
      Transformers implementation, dependencies, build worker, and decision-only tests;
      its evidence remains in the decision/finding logs and result history.
- [x] Rendering-core selection: the measured head-to-head selected exactly pinned Babylon
      Lite 1.11.0 (D-077/D-078); D-080 removed classic Babylon and renderer swappability.
      Bounded Lite integration gaps and M1/M3 follow-ups remain in D-078 and
      [rendering-engine-research.md](rendering-engine-research.md) §7.
- [x] Rust/WASM capability spikes: reproducible threaded SIMD/atomic modules qualified
  under the mandatory smoke contract (D-085/RE-035), with fail-closed worker-startup
      phase evidence that localized the former intermittent startup stall to the
      wasm-bindgen/Rust allocator overlap fixed by D-093 (D-088/D-092/RE-036). The optional
      memory64 path demonstrated exact beyond-4-GiB access and passed its paired cost gate
      (D-086); D-117 resolved P-001 after M1 selected no production module requiring
      more than one memory32 address space and removed the closed experiment apparatus.
- [x] M0 exit dependency checkpoint completed under D-079. Node 24.18.0 and CfT
      151.0.7922.34 were adopted; bounded deferrals and recheck triggers remain in
      [dependencies.md](dependencies.md).

**Exit evidence:** the historical `pnpm m0:gate` alias produced
`smoke-1-1e01757c4726-dev-01-showcase-2026-07-21T00-58-13-338Z.json` on registered
dev-01's physical console under pinned Chrome 151 and Node 24.18.0. All three facets,
all six core runs, and all 24 blocking checks passed. The result was explicitly promoted
after comparison with the same-artifact Chrome 150 anchor. RE-008 retains the
intermittent trace-completion failures rather than treating the passing replacement as
erasure; RE-036 retains the historical failures under D-093's corrected toolchain
attribution.

## M1 — Greybox District 1 streaming  `done`

- [x] Procedural D1 greybox content completed at target world scale, including cells,
      LOD tiers, collision, deterministic packaging and preview/QA evidence, together
      with the compressed-asset prerequisite: self-hosted exact KTX2/Draco/meshopt pins,
      worker integration, real fixtures, and shared fail-closed validation
      (D-078/D-089/D-090).
- [x] Long-lived OPFS streaming worker and hardware-sized decode pool, with
      player-driven nearest-nine scheduling, direct render-worker GPU upload,
      proactive farthest eviction, terminal failure handling, and mandatory
      queue/load/memory observability and budgets (D-091–D-094).
- [x] Geometry-representation spike P-002 completed and cleaned up. D-098 retains the
      triangle-LOD incumbent because neither bounded challenger produced fully eligible
      displacement evidence; D-099 governs source-identity reconstruction for future
      same-gate experiment cleanup.
- [x] Versioned ten-minute scripted flythrough established as the standard regression
      run, covering geography plus rendered lighting/weather states, deterministic
      streaming observation, environment/checkpoint identity, full-window evidence,
      repeatability, facets, and explicit budget-scope omissions (D-100–D-103).
- [x] Render-worker long-run recovery completed with generation-bound checkpoints,
      one bounded whole-cohort retry for device loss or worker failure, restored
      render/streaming hydration, exhaustion handling, and a dedicated real-fault
      physical qualifier (D-104).
- [x] In-game Benchmark mode completed with the canonical flythrough, fixed presets,
      warm-up and reset-separated repeats, environment identity, fail-honest checks,
      and JSON plus human-readable export without an external driver; unsupported
      capabilities and metrics remain explicit (D-025/D-105–D-115).
- [x] M1 exit and streaming dashboard completed: the authoritative streaming snapshot
      is visible in-game, and the versioned Showcase qualification covers the evaluated
      mandatory flythrough, recovery, settlement, fixed-handle streaming, all-realm
      heap sampling, and short-smoke repeatability contracts (D-112/D-115/D-116).

**Exit evidence:** D-115/D-116 close M1 only for registered dev-01 Showcase and the
evaluated mandatory metrics through an explicitly versioned evidence chain: D-102's
passing schema-v4/metric-set-v4 ten-minute flythrough anchor, D-104's passing
schema-v4/metric-set-v3 render-recovery qualifier, and final schema v45 / mandatory
metric set v22 smoke
`smoke-1-cf1a0420d451-dev-01-showcase-2026-07-26T03-19-56-378Z.json`, which passed
all six launches, all three facets, and 30/30 evaluated checks. Standard, physical
presentation, worker long tasks, combined CPU resident memory, and page-attributed GPU
memory remain unqualified. The complete public Benchmark reports remain retained
failures under their unchanged 10% repeat-variance checks and are advisory with budget
facets `not-evaluated`; they are not relabeled as performance passes.

**Post-M1 candidate evidence:** After D-117/D-118/D-120 and review fixes, final
schema v47 / mandatory metric set v23 report
`smoke-1-8e932618990f-dev-01-showcase-2026-07-26T12-39-01-804Z.json`
(SHA-256 `ec70dfdb8a34622641bb976d2e1b41a083653bce87a78ded9c179401842d2f4e`)
passed six launches, all three facets, and 30/30 evaluated checks. It qualifies that
post-M1 runtime artifact without reopening M1. RE-044 retains the preceding
same-artifact pre-measurement `Failed to fetch` startup failure; the one passing
classification retry does not relabel the failed attempt, and no additional post-M1
physical gate is pending.

## M2 — Install/launch/run lifecycle + caches  `pending`

The heart of the platform research. Prerequisite: production serving live on
parallax-web.com (D-011) — cache findings measured only against local serving aren't
credible.

- [ ] Production deployment to parallax-web.com with versioned nginx/header config;
      harness can target local and production and labels results accordingly. (The
      replacement landing page must not inherit the frozen placeholder's "WebAssembly
      (threads and memory64)" framing — memory64 is a D-117 reopen-only option, not part of
      the stack; the placeholder itself stays frozen per D-022.)

- [ ] Installer UX: manifest, resumable multi-GB OPFS pull, integrity check,
      persist-storage. Manifest schema distinguishes common (engine, shared packs,
      models) vs. game-specific resources with hash addressing for the common set
      (COS-ready, D-010).
- [ ] PSO trace capture + progressive warmup at boot; verify Dawn cache behavior
      launch-1 vs launch-2.
- [ ] Keep V8 code-cache lifecycle evidence as best-effort attribution
      (`instantiateStreaming`, 304/immutable discipline). For asset-only updates, retain
      paired pre/post evidence, enforce the <=10 s warm launch budget, record the launch
      delta, and calibrate any relative regression threshold through a decision (D-051).
- [ ] Service-worker offline shell (D-015): precache, cache-first navigation, atomic
      activation + rollback, COOP/COEP preserved on cached responses, version
      compatibility checks (shell/engine/manifest/save schema).
- [ ] Installer trust + crash-safety (architecture.md contract): hash verification of
      every bundle, atomic version switch, resume/rollback on interruption,
      repair-by-refetch, persist() denial and QuotaExceededError flows, best-effort
      space preflight with quota-error-aware incremental writes.
- [ ] Offline fault suite: offline hard reload, browser restart offline, corrupt-cache
      recovery, interrupted update, disk-full injection.
- [ ] Uninstall path (D-024): in-shell uninstall behind explicit confirmation with
      save-export offer; both mechanisms (client-side storage teardown, static
      `Clear-Site-Data` endpoint) built and measured for actual coverage — OPFS,
      service worker, code cache, Dawn cache — and quota release; gaps logged in
      rough-edges.md.
- [ ] Scale tests, two corpora (budgets.md, D-009/D-018): (a) ≥100 GB filler lifecycle
      corpus through install/resume/integrity/update/eviction — a floor, not a
      ceiling; grow until a platform limit is found or disproven; (b) representative
      streaming corpus (realistic encoding/entropy/file distribution/dependency
      graphs) exercising decode → GPU upload at scale; best-effort quota preflight +
      failure UX at that scale.
- [ ] Exit: cold-install and warm-launch times within budget, measured across ≥3
      machines; findings written up.

## M3 — Gameplay core + NPC AI  `pending`

- [ ] Sim worker: fixed timestep, input-commands, snapshot interpolation, save/load.
- [ ] Character controller, camera, basic interaction loop in greybox D1.
- [ ] App-owned NPC dialog (D-074/D-096): persona cards, rolling memory, strict
      structured output for state-affecting intents, authored unavailable-model
      fallback, and frame-impact measurement during WebGPU/CPU-WASM inference.
- [ ] NPC knowledge service (D-033): generic retrieval/assembly contract in `engine/ai`
      with `game/`-supplied providers; structured game-state tier implemented;
      prompt/persona schema carries the retrieved-context slot; lore authored
      chunked + tagged in `game/`. Semantic tiers (lore embeddings, episodic memory)
      stay build-later.
- [ ] Exit: playable greybox loop with conversing NPCs (incl. authored-fallback path
      with the model unavailable, D-096); save/reload round-trip; sim determinism check
      (same input log → same state hash) in the harness — **cross-machine**: replays
      must hash-match across dev-01 and mac-01 on the same pinned Chrome version
      (D-016), not just on one host.

## M4 — District 2 (catacombs) + hard transitions  `pending`

- [ ] Greybox catacombs district; multiple entrance choke points with different surface
      contexts, driven by world-graph data (game-design.md).
- [ ] Full resident-set swap meeting the transition contract in budgets.md, per entrance.
- [ ] Calibrate the per-entrance **prefetch trigger** from greybox transition
      measurements and add it to the budgets.md transition contract via a decision-log
      entry (D-055 — the contract element is deliberately undefined until these
      measurements exist).
- [ ] Exit: repeated D1↔D2 transitions through every entrance in a harness run with no
      contract violations — including the prefetch-trigger element the calibration task
      above adds; the exit cannot be declared against a contract that still lacks it.

## M5 — Art pipeline + District 1 art pass  `pending`

- [ ] assets/ pipeline live: Flow-derived reference sheets → Blender-agent generation →
      QA gate → library; kit-of-parts + trim sheets for D1's style.
- [ ] Swap greybox D1 to final art without regressing M1/M2 budgets (the real test of
      the pipeline). Add D-115's deferred deterministic visual-diff gate for no visible
      pop at the 12 m/s traversal/LOD contract against representative art; M1
      checkpoints established streamed ownership/non-blank output, not this claim.
- [ ] Exit: D1 fully art-passed, all budgets green, install size within budget.

## M6 — District 2 art, audio, polish  `pending`

- [ ] D2 art pass (distinct palette/kit).
- [ ] Spatial audio (WebAudio worklets).
- [ ] VFX and weather pass.
- [ ] Photo mode (a cheap, high-value capabilities showcase).
- [ ] Exit: end-to-end demo build a stranger can install and play.

## M7 — P2P multiplayer exploration  `parked (design constraints active now)`

- [ ] WebRTC data channels, 2–4 players, D1: presence/co-exploration first, shared sim
      second. Scope decided when M3 determinism results are in. Infrastructure per
      D-016: self-hosted signaling + STUN; TURN permitted if direct connectivity
      failure rates warrant it.

## M8 — Cross-Origin Storage exercise  `parked (blocked on COS API availability)`

The isolation/sharing model is decided (D-010: origin-per-game, sharing via COS) and
mainline work is COS-ready from M0/M2 (common/game packaging split, deterministic
versioned engine builds, hash-addressed manifest). This milestone runs the actual
exercise once COS APIs exist — it can be pulled forward whenever the Chrome-side work
wants a real-world consumer:

- [ ] Serve Parallax's common set (engine bundles, shared packs, models) from two
      "published game" origins via COS hash index; measure per-game download and
      launch delta vs. unshared.
- [ ] Validate deterministic-build discipline end-to-end: independently built engine
      bundles hash-match and share.
- [ ] Exercise code-cache (and, if available, Dawn/PSO-cache) sharing across origins;
      log findings.

*(Dropped per D-010: multi-game quota-contention, instant-play, and origin-model
comparison probes — the origin model is decided, and the rest isn't needed for this
exploration.)*

## Standing workstreams (no milestone; always on)

- **Rough-edges log:** every milestone feeds it; periodically synthesize into shareable
  write-ups.
- **Harness evolution:** new system → new metrics, same change.
- **Chrome coordination:** findings that suggest browser changes (e.g., shippable PSO
  caches, COS code-cache work) tracked in rough-edges.md with status.
